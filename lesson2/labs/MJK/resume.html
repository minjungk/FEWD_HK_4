<p>I'm a multimedia editor at The Wall Street Journal in Hong Kong. I'm currently attending a front-end web development course at General Assembly in Hong Kong. I'm hoping that I will get better understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by the end of this course, which will greatly be helpful for development of my career.</p>
